**Build and deploy production-ready DL solutions leveraging the latest Python techniques**

## What is this book about?
Deep learning enables previously unattainable feats in automation, but extracting real-world business value from it is a daunting task. This book will teach you how to build complex deep learning models and gain intuition for structuring your data to accomplish your deep learning objectives.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use neural architecture search (NAS) to automate the design of artificial neural networks (ANNs)
* Implement recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), BERT, transformers, and more to build your model
* Deal with multi-modal data drift in a production environment
* Evaluate the quality and bias of your models
* Explore techniques to protect your model from adversarial attacks
* Get to grips with deploying a model with DataRobot AutoML

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 
from tqdm import tqdm 
from lingua import Language, LanguageDetectorBuilder 
tqdm.pandas() 
```


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for deep learning practitioners, data scientists, and machine learning developers who want to explore deep learning architectures to solve complex business problems. Professionals in the broader deep learning and AI space will also benefit from the insights provided, applicable across a variety of business use cases. Working knowledge of Python programming and a basic understanding of deep learning techniques is needed to get started with this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-19).


### Software and Hardware List

The code provided in the chapters has been tested on a computer with Python 3.10, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
64-bit OS, 32 GB RAM, and an RTX 2080TI GPU for running deep learning models. Although the code
has been tested on this specific setup, it may also work on other configurations; however, compatibility
and performance are not guaranteed. Python dependencies are included in the requirements.txt
file for easy installation in each chapter’s respective GitHub folders. Additionally, some non-Python
software might be required; their installation instructions will be mentioned at the beginning of each
relevant tutorial. For these software installations, you need to refer to external manuals or guides to
install them. Do keep in mind the potential differences in system configurations as you carry out the
practical code sections in this book.
